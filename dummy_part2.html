        <h2>Section 4: Predictive Modeling (Brief Overview)</h2>
        <p>A preliminary predictive model was developed to forecast sales for the next quarter. This section briefly outlines the approach.</p>
        <h3>4.1 Model Choice</h3>
        <p>A time series ARIMA model was selected due to the temporal nature of the sales data.</p>
        <h3>4.2 Preliminary Results</h3>
        <p>The model shows a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 12% on the test set, indicating reasonable accuracy for initial forecasts.</p>
